# **Knigthly Order**

### Scope
The idea of Knightly Order started as a college project. When I submitted this game, it was as bare-bones as it could get, and very rudimentary and useless implementations were used. However, I decided to build on what I submitted, and turn it into the game I always dreamt of building.

### What story does Knightly Order tell?
Knightly Order is to be a sandbox-type, top-down game, inspired by developers such as Taleworlds and Paradox, and turn it into a role-playing scenario. The sky's the limit! From small-scale estate handling, to large-scale kingdom management and real-time battles! Well, anyway, that's the end-goal. As I'm doing this in Java with **no game engine**, the limitations might be the language itself. But I'll push the limits as far as possible.

### What plans do you have for this game?
The game is going to release as a DEMO in the future, once I believe there's enough *polished* gameplay to be experienced.

## Version 0.0.0
#### To be mentioned that 0.0.0 doesn't mean it's a playable version, as it is not currently anything but a bunch of groundworks for certain features. It is very much WIP and everything is subject to change. No changelogs will be given until a version 0.0.1 is out.

### Current Features (subject to change)

- Three playable levels with enemies
- Proper fighting animation
- Camera following the player
- Three maps built using a Factory DesignPattern for the Tiles

### Planned features:

- A Character Creation Screen (currently WIP)
- A manageable inventory
- Changing Character Image based on equipped items
- Proper Dialogue mechanics with choices
- Developing a devtool for a map-builder
